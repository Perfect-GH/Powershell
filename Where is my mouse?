Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
$X = [System.Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position.X
$Y = [System.Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position.Y
Write-Output "X: $X | Y: $Y"

<#
You can loop the output continuously by adding while ($true)

Example:
while ($true)
{
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
$X = [System.Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position.X
$Y = [System.Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position.Y
Write-Output "X: $X | Y: $Y"
}
